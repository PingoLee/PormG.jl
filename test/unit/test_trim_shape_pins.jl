# Shape pins for a trimmed build: no dynamic call where one was removed (#1599)
#
# A dynamic call is one dispatch per call under the JIT, and under `juliac --trim` it is a verifier
# row and, at run time, a `MethodError` when nothing was compiled for the target (the #1600 rounds
# on #1599). When a change removes one, a pin here keeps it removed: it reads the function's
# OPTIMIZED code by reflection, the way `test_type_ratchet.jl` reads struct fields, and fails on any
# call the compiler could not resolve.
#
# In optimized code a call whose target is known becomes `Expr(:invoke, …)`, or is inlined. What is
# left as `Expr(:call, f, …)` is either a builtin (`getfield`, `===`, an intrinsic) or a dynamic
# dispatch: a callee held in a value (an `SSAValue` typed `Function`, or anything else that is not
# a builtin's singleton type) or a generic function the compiler left unresolved. That holds with
# inlining off too (`--inline=no`, coverage runs), since a resolved call is still an `:invoke`.
#
# A pin is added when a trim row is fixed. Each one names the row and the issue.
#
# Run: julia --project=test/integration test/unit/test_trim_shape_pins.jl
