## `distinct().order_by()` — the sort key must be in the projection (raises otherwise)

- **PormG ref**: issue #76 ; `src/querybuilder/build_query.jl`
- **Recorded**: 2026-07-13
- **Severity**: behavior change (new `ArgumentError`)

### What changed

A `DISTINCT` query that orders by a column outside its projection —
`.values("a").distinct().order_by("b")` with `b` not in `values(...)` — now raises a clear
`ArgumentError` on **both** backends. Previously PostgreSQL rejected it with a raw DB error while
SQLite silently ran it, returning rows in a nondeterministic `DISTINCT`/order interaction. Ordering a
`DISTINCT` result by an unprojected column is rejected by PostgreSQL and the SQL standard (SQL Server,
Oracle, DB2, and default-mode MySQL all reject it); PormG now makes SQLite conform too. The guard
matches the resolved SQL *expression*, so ordering by a *function of* a projected column
(`order_by("created_at__@date")` while only `created_at` is selected) is likewise rejected — that too
is a PostgreSQL error.

### How to find the calls to migrate

Run the app or its tests: the new error reads
`DISTINCT query cannot ORDER BY <col>: it is not in the SELECT DISTINCT projection`. Grep for
`.distinct()` and check each one's `order_by(...)` — every ordered column (or the exact ordering
expression) must also appear in `values(...)`. **Postgres-backed apps already errored on these; only
SQLite-tested queries could have been running silently.**

### Migrate your app

```julia
# ✗ raises: surname is ordered but not projected
M.Driver.objects.values("nationality").distinct().order_by("surname").list()

# ✓ include the sort key in values() (distinct is now over both columns) …
M.Driver.objects.values("nationality", "surname").distinct().order_by("surname").list()

# ✓ … or drop distinct() if you meant "one row per nationality, ordered by an aggregate"
M.Driver.objects.values("nationality", "n" => Count("driverid")).order_by("n").list()
```
