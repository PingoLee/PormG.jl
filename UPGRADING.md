# Upgrading PormG — consumer-app rollout log

Tracks **breaking / behavior changes in PormG** that require source-code changes in the internal apps that depend on it. PormG is pre-publish (single maintainer, ~4 internal apps, no external users), so breaking changes are intentional and cheap on the *PormG* side — but each one still has to be rolled out by hand in every consuming app. This file is that rollout checklist.

> ⚠️ **Not database migrations.** This file is about migrating **app source code** to keep up with the PormG API. It is unrelated to the `makemigrations` / `migrate` schema engine that manages your database tables.

## How to use

- One `##` entry per breaking change, **newest first**.
- Each entry records: what changed, why, the concrete **before → after** code edit, and a **per-app rollout** table.
- An app is done when its code is updated **and** its tests pass against the new PormG.
- Rename the placeholder app rows (`app-1` … `app-4`) to your real app names once, then reuse them in every entry.

### Status legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ | migrated — app updated and green |
| ⏳ | pending — not yet migrated |
| — | n/a — app does not use the affected API |

## Applying these in a consuming app

This file is the **source of truth, kept in the PormG repo**. To fix a dependent app after a
PormG bump, point an agent (or yourself) at this file — read it from the dev'd source
(e.g. `~/.julia/dev/PormG/UPGRADING.md`) or from GitHub — and work the entries
**newest first**:

1. **Scope to this app.** In each entry's rollout table, skip rows already marked ✅ or —.
   Work only the ⏳ rows for this app.
2. **Find the call sites.** Run the entry's *"How to find the calls to migrate"* grep/error
   inside the app.
3. **Apply the `before → after`.** Edit each call site to the ✓ form shown in the entry.
4. **Verify.** Run the app's own test/integration suite against the upgraded PormG. An entry
   is done for this app only when its code is updated **and** its tests pass.
5. **Record it.** Flip this app's cell in that entry's rollout table to ✅ (or — if the app
   never used the affected API), and commit the table update back to PormG so the next app
   sees accurate state.

> **Tip — make it discoverable.** Add one line to each app's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`:
> *"Before bumping the PormG dependency, apply any ⏳ rows in `PormG/UPGRADING.md` for this app."*
> Then an agent working in that repo will pick up the rollout automatically.

## bulk ops `copy=` kwarg removed — the pipeline never mutates (and never copies) your DataFrame

- **PormG ref**: issue #132 ; `src/querybuilder/execution_bulk.jl`
- **Recorded**: 2026-07-12
- **Severity**: breaking (kwarg removed) / behavior improvement

### What changed

`bulk_insert`, `bulk_copy`, and `bulk_update` no longer accept `copy::Bool`. The old
default (`copy=true`) deep-copied the entire DataFrame on every call; `copy=false` let
ORM-side normalization (default fills, `auto_now` columns) leak into the caller's frame.
The pipeline now works on a **zero-copy wrapper** (shared column vectors): the caller's
DataFrame is **never mutated and never copied**, unconditionally — strictly better than
both old modes. `allocate_primary_keys` is unchanged: `clone=true` still returns an
independent copy (that frame is *returned* to the caller, so it must not alias your
data), and `clone=false` still writes the pk column in place.

### How to find the calls to migrate

Grep each app for `copy=` / `copy =` on `bulk_insert`/`bulk_copy`/`bulk_update` calls
(or just run the app: passing the removed kwarg raises
`MethodError: ... got unsupported keyword argument "copy"`).

### Migrate your app

```julia
# ✗ before
bulk_insert(query, df, copy=true)    # paid a full deepcopy
bulk_update(query, df, columns=["points"], match_on=["id"], copy=false)  # mutated df

# ✓ after — just drop the kwarg; no-mutation is now the unconditional contract
bulk_insert(query, df)
bulk_update(query, df, columns=["points"], match_on=["id"])
```

If an app relied on `copy=false` to *receive* the injected columns (e.g. reading
`df.updated_at` after the call), that back-channel is gone — read the values back
through a query instead.

One subtle semantics shift: the old `copy=true` gave the bulk op a private *snapshot*
of your data; the zero-copy wrapper reads your live column vectors **during** the call.
Don't mutate the DataFrame from another task while a bulk op is executing on it (this
was never supported — it just happened to be masked by the default deepcopy).

## `bulk_update(match_on=)` — pairs removed; `columns=` is the single df→field mapping point

- **PormG ref**: issue #107 ; `src/querybuilder/execution_bulk.jl`
- **Recorded**: 2026-07-12
- **Severity**: breaking

### What changed

`match_on=` no longer accepts `"df_col" => "model_field"` pairs. It takes **bare model
field names** only; `columns=` is now the **single place** a DataFrame column is mapped
to a model field ("one border crossing"). A field listed in both `columns=` and
`match_on=` is used for **matching only — it is never SET** (this was already true).
A bare `match_on` name resolves its source column **mapping-first**: the `columns=`
mapping when declared (authoritative — a same-named DataFrame column is ignored with a
warning), otherwise a DataFrame column with the field's own name.

### How to find the calls to migrate

Run the app or its tests: every old pair raises
`bulk_update: match_on= no longer accepts "df_col" => "model_field" pairs (DEPRECATED API)`
with the exact rewrite. Or grep for `match_on` and inspect any entry containing `=>`.

### Migrate your app

```julia
# ✗ before
bulk_update(query, df,
    columns  = ["new_score" => "points"],
    match_on = ["record_id" => "id"])

# ✓ after — the pair moves to columns=; match_on keeps the bare field name
bulk_update(query, df,
    columns  = ["new_score" => "points", "record_id" => "id"],
    match_on = ["id"])
```

Bare-name calls (`match_on = ["id"]` with an `id` DataFrame column, or relying on the
primary-key fallback) need no change.
