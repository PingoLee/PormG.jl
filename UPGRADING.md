# Upgrading PormG — consumer-app rollout log

Tracks **breaking / behavior changes in PormG** that require source-code changes in the internal apps that depend on it. PormG is pre-publish (single maintainer, ~4 internal apps, no external users), so breaking changes are intentional and cheap on the *PormG* side — but each one still has to be rolled out by hand in every consuming app. This file is that rollout checklist.

> ⚠️ **Not database migrations.** This file is about migrating **app source code** to keep up with the PormG API. It is unrelated to the `makemigrations` / `migrate` schema engine that manages your database tables.

## How to use

- One `##` entry per breaking change, **newest first**.
- Each entry records: what changed, why, the concrete **before → after** code edit, and a **per-app rollout** table.
- An app is done when its code is updated **and** its tests pass against the new PormG.
- Rename the placeholder app rows (`app-1` … `app-4`) to your real app names once, then reuse them in every entry.

### Status legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ | migrated — app updated and green |
| ⏳ | pending — not yet migrated |
| — | n/a — app does not use the affected API |

## Applying these in a consuming app

This file is the **source of truth, kept in the PormG repo**. To fix a dependent app after a
PormG bump, point an agent (or yourself) at this file — read it from the dev'd source
(e.g. `~/.julia/dev/PormG/UPGRADING.md`) or from GitHub — and work the entries
**newest first**:

1. **Scope to this app.** In each entry's rollout table, skip rows already marked ✅ or —.
   Work only the ⏳ rows for this app.
2. **Find the call sites.** Run the entry's *"How to find the calls to migrate"* grep/error
   inside the app.
3. **Apply the `before → after`.** Edit each call site to the ✓ form shown in the entry.
4. **Verify.** Run the app's own test/integration suite against the upgraded PormG. An entry
   is done for this app only when its code is updated **and** its tests pass.
5. **Record it.** Flip this app's cell in that entry's rollout table to ✅ (or — if the app
   never used the affected API), and commit the table update back to PormG so the next app
   sees accurate state.

> **Tip — make it discoverable.** Add one line to each app's `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`:
> *"Before bumping the PormG dependency, apply any ⏳ rows in `PormG/UPGRADING.md` for this app."*
> Then an agent working in that repo will pick up the rollout automatically.

*No pending entries — all recorded changes have been rolled out to the consuming apps.*

## Template for new entries

<!--
Copy the block below to the top of the log (under the legend) for each new breaking change.

## `<api>` — <one-line summary of the change>

- **PormG ref**: <TODO.md item / PR / commit> ; <src file>
- **Recorded**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- **Severity**: breaking | behavior change | deprecation

### What changed
<what the old API did vs. the new contract>

### How to find the calls to migrate
<error message to grep for, or the call pattern>

### Migrate your app
```julia
# ✗ before
...
# ✓ after
...
```
